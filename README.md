A continually increasing number of high-quality digital strong-motion records from stations of the National Strong Motion Project (NSMP) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), as well as data from regional seismic networks within the U.S., called for automated processing of strong-motion records with human review limited to selected significant or flagged records. This PRISM (Processing and Review Interface for Strong Motion data) repository contains the software for the automated record processing engine, designed to perform data processing on earthquake sensor data, transforming raw sensor counts into acceleration, velocity, and displacement information.

PRISM is platform-independent, coded in Java, and open-source. To support use by earthquake engineers and scientists, PRISM is easy to install and run as a stand-alone system on common operating systems such as Linux, OS X and Windows.

The source code contains some additional NetBeans files to facilitate building code outside of an IDE or to bring the code into the NetBeans IDE. PRISM was developed with NetBeans version 8.0. The main file is Prism.java in the src/SmControl package. PRISM was developed in Java 1.8. There is a set of JavaDocs to accompany the code.
