	The WriteBaselineFunction flag, if set to 'On', will cause the baseline functions created
	during adaptive baseline correction (ABC) to be written as text files into the output folder.
	It will also write the velocity array just before baseline correction.
	The name of the files will be the V0 file name with either "baseline.txt"  or
